			<p>Comprehensive Autism Partnership, Inc. was born from the desire to give children with autism the best treatment possible. This includes, most importantly, in-home ABA programs as well as parent training and help understanding school, social, family, dietary and bio-medical options.</p>

 			<p>Our main offices are in Fredericksburg and Alexandria, Virginia where we are in-network approved Tricare providers.</p>

 			<p>We now accept medicaid, Tricare, and most private insurances, but, unfortunately, can no longer accept Aetna.</p>
